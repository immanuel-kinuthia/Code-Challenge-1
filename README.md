# Week 1 Code Challenge

Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator: Estimates the ingredients needed to prepare a specific number of cups of Kenyan chai based on a standard recipe.

Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator: Calculates the estimated fare for a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) ride based on distance traveled.
